# DotPlot\_Maker

Mummer slightly modified and script to generate dotplots using mummer, compiled as 64bit under Ubuntu.

MUMmer3.23 changes (note also the separate license for mummer)

- /src/kurtz/libbasedir/types.h - modified to flag for 64 bit compilation
- mummerplot - tweaked x11 sizes and defaults etc, and some bug fixes
- executables soft-linked and renamed during install to not flood the PATH
